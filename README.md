About the project

Key Performance Indicators (KPI) is a subset of performance indicators most critical to business. It is a type of performance measurement that helps to understand how the organization or department is performing. The key focus is to identify KPI for the given sales data. Once, the key KPI is in place, then further data analysis should be based on the KPIs. In the given sales data, the online ordering of products is based on the category. The “quantity ordered” in each category of product is to be analyzed. In the PowerBI dashboard, the first visual shows the sum of the quantity ordered in each category of products.



The PowerBI helps to create the dashboard for the business. The key KPI in this online business is the quantity the customers purchase under categories like Mobiles & tablets, appliances, men’s fashion, women’s fashion, entertainment, Home & living, etc. The next KPI is the status of orders such as complete, canceled, refunded, etc. The status of the order helps to analyze the customer behavior on product choice. The next KPI is the location of the customer helps to identify the people’s interest in the products they buy online. The next analysis is based on gender helps to find out the gender-based interest in purchasing products online. The next analysis is based on the month for instance in the month of December the sale of mobiles & tablets, women’s and men’s fashion is more compared to other months of online purchases. The analysis based on the discount amount is done using the product category. The final interactive PowerBI dashboard is created.
